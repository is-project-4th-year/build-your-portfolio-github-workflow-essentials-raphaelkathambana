## 3. Learnings from the Git Crash Program

List at least **four key concepts or skills** you learned during the Git crash course. For each one, write a brief explanation of how it helped you manage your portfolio project more effectively.

- **Milestones and Issues**: Enabled me to track progress and manage tasks efficiently by breaking down the project into manageable parts.
- **Project Board**: Allowed me to visualize the workflow and prioritize tasks, making it easier to see what needed to be done next.
- **Pull Requests**: Facilitated code reviews and discussions, ensuring that changes were well-documented and approved before merging into the main branch.
- **Merge Conflict Resolution**: Taught me how to handle conflicts that arise when multiple changes are made to the same part of the code, ensuring a smooth integration process.
- **Commit Messages**: Emphasized the importance of clear and descriptive commit messages, which helped in understanding the history of changes made to the project.
- **Collaboration**: Improved my ability to work with others by using GitHub features like issues and pull requests to communicate changes and feedback effectively.
